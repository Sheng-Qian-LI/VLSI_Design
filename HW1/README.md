# **HW1 : Inverter simulation**  

  #### In this assignment, I will design the size of the inverter and perform simulations using 180nm and 14nm process technologies. The simulations will be simulated under three process corners (TT, SS, FF). Design the transfer curve with 𝑉𝐷𝐷 = 1𝑉 and transition point 𝑉𝑀 = 0.5𝑉𝐷𝐷. (𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 0.5𝑉𝐷𝐷@𝑉𝑖𝑛 = 0.5𝑉𝐷𝐷)

  ## 180nm
### Specification
###### VDD = 1V  
##### NMOS : (W/L) = 1um/0.18um  

### Result
